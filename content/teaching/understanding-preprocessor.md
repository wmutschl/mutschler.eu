This is a Zoom recording (hope the quality is still okay) of a session on Dynare's preprocessor and what it actually does.
<!--more-->
I illustrate preprocessing on a RBC model by manually re-doing some steps in MATLAB with a focus on writing out script files of the static/dynamic model equations and Jacobians.
Note that Dynare's preprocessor is written in C++ and is capable to do much more things than I cover in this video, but I still hope this is useful for people who need to manually preprocess a DSGE model.
