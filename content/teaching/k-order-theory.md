title: 'Solving DSGE models with k-order perturbation: what Dynare does'
date: "2022-06-15"
---
This video is a didactic reference and in-depth review of k-order perturbation.
<!--more-->
The first 80 minutes of the video cover the ingredients, notation and mathematical concepts underlying the perturbation approach.
The second-part goes into a detail exposition of the algorithmic steps to recover the coefficients of the approximated policy functions. The focus is really on understanding the general algorithm and how the tools and concepts from the first part can be applied.
We also cover implementation details in Dynare.  

*Warning: this video is not targeted at beginners or newcomers to DSGE models, but for those who want to understand the perturbation approach in quite some detail.*
