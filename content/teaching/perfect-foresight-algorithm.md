We cover deterministic simulations in DSGE models also known as perfect foresight simulations and how one can do this in Dynare.

1) We will cover very briefly the intuition behind this method.
2) We are going to illustrate several scenarios which you can analyze using a two-country New Keynesian DSGE model as an example.
3) We will go through the Dynare specific commands that you need know.
4) We will go under the hood and derive the Newton type algorithm that Dynare uses and discuss some numerical issues we need to deal with.
5) To make sure that we really understand the algorithm and the way Dynare computes deterministic simulations, we are going to re-implement it manually in MATLAB and then see that the results are exactly the same.
