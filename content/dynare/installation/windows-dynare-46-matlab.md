- 05:49 - Copy example1.mod
- 06:03 - Add Dynare to MATLAB's path via addpath (don't use GUI as this might mess up other computations you do in MATLAB)
- 06:15 - First check: just run dynare
- 06:22 - Second check: run example1.mod
- 06:36 - MATLAB preferences: add "mod" to files extensions for nicer code formatting in MATLAB's editor
